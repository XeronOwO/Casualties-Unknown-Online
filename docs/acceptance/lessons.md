# Acceptance lessons

What the runs keep teaching. Every acceptance run folds its reusable lessons back here before it
closes ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) rule 9); a lesson that stays in a transcript is lost, and the next
batch pays for it again. Machine values and local gotchas belong in `AGENTS.local.md`, not here; a
rule that binds the whole repository graduates to `docs/AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.md`.

## How to add an entry

One entry per lesson, newest last, in this shape:

```text
## <date> — <what happened, as a headline>

- Symptom: <what the run saw>
- Cause: <the mechanism, not the story>
- Change: <the file and rule that now carry it>
```

An entry is worth adding when it would change what the next run does: a preflight check that lied, a
scenario setup that turned out to need something extra, an evidence kind that was not convincing, a
dependency the table did not name, a step that cost more than it returned.

## 2026-09-27 — The preflight matched nothing on its first run (PowerShell 5.1 code pages)

- Symptom: `preflight.ps1` reported `no 验收环境 section resolved` and then `FACT-MISSING` for every
  key, while the facts file plainly carried the section.
- Cause: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a UTF-8 file without a BOM — the script itself, and the facts
  file it read — through the system code page, so the Chinese heading in the script and the one in
  the file were mangled into two different strings that could never match.
- Change: the script is ASCII-only and matches an ASCII section marker
  (`## 验收环境 / acceptance environment`), and reads the facts with an explicit `-Encoding UTF8`.
  A committed script must never depend on how the host guesses its own encoding.

## 2026-09-27 — Auto-loaded instruction files are a budget, and it was nearly spent

- Symptom: adding the area's two instruction files (measured on the working tree, 2026-09-27:
  `docs/acceptance/AGENTS.md` 4,799 bytes + `docs/acceptance/AGENTS.local.md` 2,670 bytes = 7,469) put
  the sum of every instruction file 906 bytes over the 65,536-byte budget, while the always-present root
  pair already used 90% of it.
- Cause: nobody had measured the budget before adding two auto-loaded files, and the gate counted every
  nested file into the same budget — which is not what the loader charges. It charges the always-present
  pair and drops the user-level instruction file when they leave no room (the session reported exactly
  that).
- Change: `AgentInstructionBudgetGateTests` now measures what the loader charges — the always-loaded root
  pair against the budget (58,973 bytes that day: `AGENTS.md` 18,746 + `AGENTS.local.md` 40,227, leaving
  6,563), and every other instruction file, tracked or area-local, against its own 5,120-byte ceiling.
  That headroom is less than the 19,456-byte user-level file, so the loader still drops it; restoring it
  needs 12,893 bytes of cuts from the root pair. Measure a file's bytes before adding one, and prefer a
  page over a router.

## 2026-09-27 — An instruction file can be at its ceiling before you touch it

- Symptom: naming the new area in `docs/AGENTS.md` §1 pushed the file to 5,447 bytes and the nested
  ceiling gate refused the build; `docs/AGENTS.md` now sits at 5,1xx of its 5,120-byte allowance.
- Cause: the router had grown to within ~90 bytes of its own ceiling, so any added sentence breaks it —
  and the fix is not to raise the ceiling but to say the same thing in fewer words.
- Change: the fact was folded into the existing bullets and redundancy trimmed in §1/§2/§4/§7. Measure a
  file's byte size before editing an instruction file, and prefer moving detail into a page over growing
  the router.

## 2026-09-27 — A preflight that only reports is not yet a run

- Symptom: the first green-ish preflight reported `artifacts` missing because the artifact directory
  did not exist; nothing was wrong with the machine.
- Cause: a writable evidence directory is a dependency like any other, and creating it is setup the
  run owns — not a question for the user.
- Change: a missing artifact directory is created by the run before it asks anything; the preflight
  keeps reporting it, because "not created yet" and "not writable" look the same from outside.

## 2026-09-27 — A machine fact can be green and still be the wrong game

- Symptom: `steam://rungameid/<game-app-id>` launched an unrelated game (Forts) on the acceptance
  machine, while the `steam` preflight row read `present` and even echoed the app id.
- Cause: the local facts file carried the wrong `game-app-id`. The preflight proves only that the key
  is set; it never proves that the id maps to the `game-dir` install, and the launch step consumes the
  fact directly, so the wrong value reached a real launch. The correct id is in the install's own
  `steam_appid.txt` and in the app manifest's name.
- Change: the fact is corrected, and a run must cross-check the id against the install before
  launching. The preflight should compare the two instead of reporting the key alone.

## 2026-09-27 — An interrupted test run leaves a testhost that reddens the next one

- Symptom: a later full-suite run failed to build its test project (MSB3026/MSB3027, "file is being
  used by another process", `testhost.net48`), while the gate project passed 288/288 in the same run.
- Cause: an earlier `dotnet test` invocation that never completed left `testhost.net48` holding
  `xunit.abstractions.dll` in the test project's `bin` directory.
- Change: check for `testhost*` processes started by this run and stop them before re-running the
  suite. A full-suite red that is a file lock is an environment finding, not a product finding.

## 2026-09-27 — In-process control is the driver this machine allows

- Symptom: the session batch looked blocked on the staged `input` capability; asking the user settled
  it: the agent may drive the game from inside its process, but must never take over the physical
  mouse and keyboard.
- Cause: the `input` row describes scripted keyboard/mouse driving — neither built nor permitted here.
  What the run actually needs is the in-process evaluator (`hotrepl-*`), which is present.
- Change: session setups are driven through the evaluator (create/join were both proven this way);
  when the harness lands, the `input` row's capability and degradation text must be rewritten around
  in-process control instead of OS input.

## 2026-09-27 — A title-screen click is not "start the game"

- Symptom: the probe created the lobby (`Session role: Host`) and the guest joined
  (`role=Guest`), but invoking the title screen's SleepingBag `AdaptiveButton.Clicked()` shut the
  host client down cleanly instead of starting a run.
- Cause: each title-screen object carries its own action, and nothing in the object's name says which
  one starts a run; calling a handler outside a real pointer event exercised whatever that object
  does. "It ran" is not "it did what the scenario needed".
- Change: session actions go through the Online UI's own entry points; before any in-process click of
  a scene object is used as a setup step, its handler's target must be identified from evidence.

## 2026-09-27 — A delegated triage needs a machine-checkable contract

- Symptom: three read-only triage subagents classified the 142 `review/` tickets; two reports listed
  slugs outside their own input slice and their headline counts disagreed with their own lists (one
  headlined "24 offline" while listing 44 slugs).
- Cause: the prompts fixed the rubric but not a verifiable contract, so a report could be internally
  inconsistent and still look finished.
- Change: a triage delegation must echo its exact input list, emit exactly one class line per slug,
  derive every count from those lines, and the orchestrator re-derives the counts from the file
  before any batch is built on it.
